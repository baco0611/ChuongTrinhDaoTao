# Web Project for Managing Training Programs at Hue University of Sciences

This is a project by students Huynh Van Nguyen Bao and Nguyen Thi Van Anh, who are students of the K45 class of the Information Technology Department, Hue University of Science. This project is a product entered into the Student Scientific Research and Technology Competition guided by Dr. Tran Thanh Luong.

The project structure consists of two parts: a front end using React and a back end implemented with Java, which are connected to each other through RestAPIs.
The file structure includes two main folders named frontend and backend, organized as follows:
QLCTDT
